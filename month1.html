                    beaches in North Goa – Baga, Candolim, Calangute and Anjuna can get quite crowded, especially during
                    the weekends, the Christmas and New Year time. The South is relatively quiet, but there are more
                    tourists here too. Cooler than November and more pleasant. It rains for just 1 day this month in an
                    average year. Beautiful sunny weather as Goa receives 10 hours of sunlight every day. The average
                    temperature is 32°C, about the same as November. A pleasant wind blows in from the sea. Best time of
                    the year at Goa. A hot party month in Goa(Sunburn,Supersonic Festival,Mando Festival, etc).
                    There are parties everywhere, beach shacks, and even right on the beaches. The south is
                    relatively quieter, but after sundown,
                    the south too comes alive with parties.</p>
