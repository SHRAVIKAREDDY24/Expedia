                <p align="justify"> India takes pride in flaunting its unsurpassed heritage. With a startling number of
                    places and monuments enlisted in the list of
                    UNESCO World Heritage Sites, India has made an indelible mark in world history.

                    From the float of crocodiles at Sunderban National Park to the home of snow
                    leopards at Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, from the majestic Manas Wildlife Sanctuary to the Keoladeo
                    National Park and Kaziranga National Park, India humbly possess the most diverse heritage in the
                    world. The lush flora and the tailored landscape around it has been the prime attraction in the
                    country, right from the red rhododendrons to the Neelakurinji, which bloom once every 12 years and
                    from the moonscape Ladakh to the river island Majuli, the kaleidoscope of wildlife and natural
                    heritage never ceases to amaze us in India. </p>

                <p align="justify"> India’s culture is among the world’s oldest; civilization in India began about 4,500
                    years ago. Many sources describe it as “Sa Prathama Sanskrati Vishvavara” — the first and the
                    supreme culture in the world, according to the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) organization.
                    In this view, societies outside of Europe or North
                    America, or societies that did not follow the European or Western way of life, were considered
                    primitive and culturally inferior.

                    However, Indians made significant advances in architecture (Taj Mahal), mathematics (the invention
                    of zero) and medicine (Ayurveda). Today, India is a very diverse country
                    different regions have their own distinct cultures. Language, religion, food and the arts are just
                    some of the various aspects of Indian culture.</p>

                <p align="justify">The Indian mythologies describe the country as the land of austerity, pilgrimages,
                    rituals, and mystical customs. And it proves to be true when one embarks on a journey as a pilgrim.
                    Hundreds of deep-rooted beliefs, hundreds of spiritual thoughts followed by vivid customs bless this
                    land of incredibility. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Saurashtra to Silchar (Assam) every nook and
                    corner of this country is dotted with significant pilgrimage sites which are either dedicated to
                    Hindu deities or Buddhist lamas or Gurus. A journey to these holy sites of India is considered a
                    lifetime achievement and endows the pilgrims with peace of mind and mental strength.

                    temperate forests, rivers, plains and even an island archipelago. It is therefore not surprising
                    that India hosts 7.6% of the world’s mammal population, 12.6% of all birds, 11.7% of all fish, 4.4%
                    of all amphibians and 6% of all flowering plant species. Recent decades have seen the population of
                    India grow immensely, which has posed a massive threat to India’s wildlife. As a result of this
                    problem, as well as the implications of illegal hunting and poaching, the system of national parks
                    and reserves first established in 1935 has expanded. There are now 87 National Parks, 13 Bio
                    reserves and over 400 wildlife sanctuaries located throughout the country.Animals like the Asian
                    Elephant, the Bengal Tiger, the Asiatic Lion, the Leopard and the Indian Rhinoceros are very
                    important to Indian culture and are associated with deities. </p>

                    many other countries. It is known for its large assortment of dishes and its liberal use of herbs
                    and spices. Cooking styles vary from region to region.
                    Wheat, Basmati rice and pulses with chana (Bengal gram) are important staples of the Indian diet.
                    The food is rich with curries and spices, including ginger, coriander, cardamom, turmeric, dried hot
                    peppers, and cinnamon, among others. Chutneys — thick condiments and spreads made from assorted
                    fruits and vegetables such as tamarind and tomatoes and mint, cilantro and other herbs — are used
                    generously in Indian cooking.
